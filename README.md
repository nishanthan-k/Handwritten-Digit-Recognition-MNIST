# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-MNIST

This repository contains code for training and evaluating a deep learning model to classify digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- TensorFlow: Install using `pip install tensorflow`
- Numpy: Install using `pip install numpy`
- Matplotlib: Install using `pip install matplotlib`

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is included in the TensorFlow library, so there's no need to download it separately. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 28x28 pixels.
